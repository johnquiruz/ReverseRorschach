# ReverseRorschach

**ReverseRorschach** is a semantic painting search tool built on a curated collection of approximately 300 hand-picked paintings. Each painting in this collection has been carefully selected for its artistic and emotional significance.

The semantic meaning of each painting is mapped using advanced AI reasoning and mathematical proximity, allowing users to search for artworks based on emotional or conceptual queries. The AI analyzes and organizes the paintings in a way that reflects their inferred emotional and symbolic content.
